This project is a Flask-based SMS chatbot that uses Twilio to handle SMS communication and Google search functionality to provide search results. When a user sends a query via SMS, the bot processes the input, performs a Google search for relevant results, and responds with the top three URLs. It is designed to facilitate quick information retrieval directly through text messaging.
